# Chat – Private Section

The chat functionality is not included in this public repository.

In the full application, the chat feature provides:
- Real-time conversation interface
- Communication with a fine-tuned AI model
- Emotional support responses
- Message handling and state management
- User-specific context awareness

To protect private AI logic and backend integrations, only this placeholder is publicly available.

A visual preview of the chat interface is included in the PDF portfolio document.
