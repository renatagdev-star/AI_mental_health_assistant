# Header – Private Section

The original Header component is not included in this public repository.

In the full application, the header manages:
- Authentication state (signed in / signed out)
- User account menu
- Protected navigation links
- Integration with Clerk authentication

Because it contains authentication logic and internal application structure,
the component has been replaced with this placeholder in the portfolio version.

Only non-sensitive UI components are included publicly.
